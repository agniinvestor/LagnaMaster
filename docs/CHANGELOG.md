## Session History

### S1–S5 — Pilot Build

- **S1**: `ephemeris.py` — pyswisseph wrapper, BirthChart dataclass. P-1 (midnight fix: `if hour is None`), P-4 (bad ayanamsha → ValueError), N-1 (Narayana Dasa Taurus=7yr) all fixed. 14 tests.
- **S2**: `src/calculations/` — 7 Jyotish modules (dignity, nakshatra, friendship, house_lord, chara_karak, narayana_dasa, shadbala). 36 tests.
- **S3**: `scoring.py` (22-rule engine) + `api/main.py` (5 endpoints) + `db.py` (SQLite, `_SENTINEL` pattern, WAL mode). 20 tests.
- **S4**: `ui/app.py` — Streamlit 3-tab UI. 6 tests.
- **S5**: Docker Compose + Dockerfile + Makefile + integration tests. 17 tests.
- **Total S1–S5**: 93/93 tests passing.

### S6–S10 — Accuracy Completion

- **S6**: `vimshottari_dasa.py` + `chart_visual.py` (South Indian SVG 520×520px, CELL=130px) + 4-tab UI. 20 tests.
- **S7**: `yogas.py` (13 yoga types: PM/Raj/Dhana/Lunar/Solar/Special) + enriched planet table + Yogas tab in UI. 14 tests.
- **S8**: `ashtakavarga.py` (Parashari 8-source bindu tables, fixed totals Sun=50/Moon=48/Mars=42/Mercury=55/Jupiter=57/Venus=52/Saturn=40/Sarva=344). E-1/A-2 regression guards. S-2 fixed (Chesta Bala formula: `min(60, mean_motion/|speed|×60)`). 26 tests.
- **S9**: `gochara.py` (transit analysis, Sade Sati, AV bindus) + Shadbala UI surface + Transits tab. 29 tests.
- **S10**: `panchanga.py` (5-limb almanac: Tithi/Vara/Nakshatra/Yoga/Karana + D9) + Navamsha SVG (`navamsha_svg()`). 40 tests.
- **Total S1–S10**: 222/222 tests passing (pilot complete).

### S11–S108 — Extended Classical Depth

*Sessions adding additional calculation modules, scoring refinements, ADB import pipeline, additional yoga types, Streamlit UI extensions, and accuracy fixes. Test count grew from 222 → ~990.*

Key milestones:
- ADB XML importer (`tools/adb_xml_importer.py`) — batch fixture import
- Extended yogas, additional Shadbala sub-components
- Streamlit 7-tab UI completion (all tabs: Chart/Scores/Yogas/AV/Dasha/Transits/Rules)
- Docker → K8s planning, Next.js consumer UI scaffolding
- `packages.txt` (`gcc g++ python3-dev`) confirmed for Streamlit Cloud pyswisseph compilation

### S109–S160 — Classical Audit Phase

*Systematic audit against BPHS, Phaladeepika, Saravali, Brihat Jataka, Jaimini Sutras. Heuristic scoring engine noted as non-classical methodology. Phase 0 correctness fixes applied.*

Key milestones:
- Multi-axis scoring (`multi_axis_scoring.py`) — D1/D9/D10/CL/SL axis architecture
- Scoring V3 scaffolding (`scoring_v3.py`) — dasha-sensitized score infrastructure
- School-mixing fix (Jaimini/Parashari strict separation via `calc_config.py`)
- All 12 Lagnas covered in ADB fixture set
- Regression snapshot infrastructure (J-2)

---

## S161 — Topocentric Moon (FLG_TOPOCTR)

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**What was wired:**
- `ephemeris.py`: `swe.set_topo(lat, lon, 0)` called before Moon calculation
- `SEFLG_TOPOCTR` flag added for Moon only
- Corrects Moon parallax up to 1° — critical for nakshatra boundary cases
- 177 ADB fixture files regenerated post-correction

---

## S162 — Functional Dignity in R02/R09

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**What was wired:**
- `multi_axis_scoring.py` R02/R09: replaced natural (Naisargika) classification with `compute_functional_classifications(lagna_si)`
- Saturn yogakaraka from Capricorn lagna now scores differently to Saturn functional malefic from Cancer lagna
- Approximately 8% of charts affected

---

## S163–S186 — Scoring Depth + School Fixes + Regression Snapshot

*Additional scoring invariants, school-mixing architecture fixes, regression snapshot infrastructure (J-2), ADB fixture expansion. Tests grew from ~990 → ~1300.*

---

## S187 — Scoring Wiring Gaps Closed

**Tests:** ~1310+ passing  
**Commit message:** `feat(S187): wire scoring gaps — war loser penalty, dasha scoring, strict_school`

### multi_axis_scoring.py
- **War loser penalty**: `_score_one_house` now checks `bh_war_loser`:
  ```python
  bh_war_loser = bhavesh in getattr(chart, 'planetary_war_losers', set())
  # If True → -1.5 penalty to house score (permanent, not just at time of war)
  # Classical source: Saravali Ch.4 v.18-22
  ```
- **strict_school**: `score_axis()` and `score_all_axes()` accept `strict_school: bool = False`. When `True`, `school_score_adjustment()` deducts forbidden-school rule contributions. *Note: R17/R18 currently score 0.0 so no numeric change yet.*

### scoring_v3.py
- `score_chart_with_dasha()` stub replaced with real implementation accepting `base_scores` param
- `score_chart_v3()` now calls it after `score_all_axes()`, mutating `axes.d1.scores` when `on_date` supplied
- D1 scores are now dasha-sensitized when a query date is provided

### New Invariants
- **#35**: War loser bhavesh = −1.5 to house score (Saravali Ch.4 v.18-22) — **live**
- **#36**: `strict_school=True` deducts Jaimini contributions in Parashari mode — **live**

---

## S188 — XIX Output/API + Postgres Routing + Swiss Ephemeris

**Tests:** 1338 passing, 3 skipped (require live PG_DSN), 0 lint errors, CI green  
**Commit message:** `docs(S188): sync all documentation — S187 wiring gaps, S188 XIX API, SE upgrade`

### src/api/main.py
- Version bumped to `3.0.0`
- `src.db` → `src.db_pg` (Postgres routing — auto-falls back to SQLite if `PG_DSN` not set)
- 5 new endpoints added:

| Endpoint | Module | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `POST /charts/{id}/svg` | `north_indian_chart.py` | North/South Indian SVG |
| `POST /charts/{id}/pdf` | `pdf_export.py` | 2-page PDF (weasyprint / HTML fallback) |
| `POST /charts/{id}/guidance` | `guidance_api.py` | Consumer L1/L2/L3 guidance |
| `GET /charts/{id}/confidence` | `confidence_model.py` | Lagna/nakshatra boundary warnings |
| `GET /charts/{id}/scores/v3` | `scoring_v3.py` | Dasha-sensitized multi-axis scores |

### src/api/models.py
Added: `SVGRequest`, `SVGOut`, `GuidanceRequest`, `GuidanceOut`, `ConfidenceOut`, `ChartV3Out`

### Swiss Ephemeris Upgrade
- Real SE files downloaded from `github.com/aloistr/swisseph`:
  - `sepl_18.se1` (473K — planets) + `semo_18.se1` (1.2M — Moon)
- pyswisseph now uses JPL DE431 — Moshier fallback **retired**
- Verified: `swe.calc_ut()` returns `flags=258` (FLG_SWIEPH=2 + FLG_SPEED=256), confirming real files active
- Historical charts (pre-1800): requires `seplm_18.se1` + `semom_18.se1`

### ADB Fixtures
- 177 existing fixture files regenerated post-FLG_TOPOCTR Moon correction
- 7 new fixtures added: Ambedkar, Bush, Kennedy, Rockefeller, Roosevelt FDR, Tata JRD, Wells HG
- All 12 Lagnas now covered across 200+ real birth charts

## S189 — [DATE TBD] — [FILL IN AFTER COMPLETION]

**Commit:** [FILL IN]  
**Tests:** [FILL IN]

### What was built / fixed
[FILL IN]

S190 — [FILL IN]

## S193 — 2026-03-28 — HouseScore Distribution Dataclass

**Commit:** (see git log)
**Tests:** 1490 passing, 3 skipped (require live PG_DSN), 0 lint errors, CI green

### What was built
- `src/calculations/house_score.py`: `HouseScore` dataclass with fields
  `house`, `score`, `mean`, `std`, `p10`, `p90` plus `to_dict()` for JSON
  serialisation.  `compute_house_scores(chart, school)` wraps D1 scoring and
  confidence-interval propagation to produce `dict[int, HouseScore]`.
- `tests/test_s193_housescore_distribution.py`: 6 tests covering dataclass
  fields, JSON serialisation, distribution ordering (p10 ≤ mean ≤ p90),
  full dict shape, and India 1947 H2-negative regression.

### What was wired
- `ChartScoresV3` gains a `house_distributions: dict` field (backward-compat)
  populated by `compute_house_scores()` inside `score_chart_v3()`.

### New invariants
- #37: `HouseScore.p10 <= HouseScore.mean <= HouseScore.p90` — always enforced
  by construction (normal-distribution percentile derivation from 95 % CI).

### Three-Lens Notes
- Tech: House scores are now typed objects — consumers can extract uncertainty
  bands without re-running the confidence model.
- Astrology: Distribution width reflects birth-time uncertainty (±5 min) and
  Lagna/Moon nakshatra boundary proximity.
- Research: p10/p90 bands enable ensemble-style prediction intervals.

### Next session
S194 — [TBD]

## S194 — 2026-03-28 — Conditional Weight Functions W(planet, house, lagna, functional_role)

**Commit:** (see git log)
**Tests:** 1503 passing, 3 skipped (require live PG_DSN), 0 lint errors, CI green

### What was built
- `src/calculations/conditional_weights.py`: `WeightContext` dataclass and
  `W(ctx) -> float` function that replaces flat static rule weights with
  context-conditional modifiers:
  - Yogakaraka × YK_MULT (1.5 Parashari/KP, 1.25 Jaimini) — early-return
  - Functional benefic + positive rule × 1.2
  - Functional malefic + negative rule × 1.2 (stronger affliction)
  - Role mismatch × 0.75 (cross-direction mitigation)
  - Kendra/Trikona house + positive rule × 1.1
  - Dusthana house + negative rule × 1.1
  - `g06_compliant` property: KP school requires Krishnamurti ayanamsha (G06)
- `tests/test_s194_conditional_weights.py`: 13 tests covering all modifiers,
  G06 compliance flags, and role-alignment logic.

### What was wired
- `build_context()` convenience constructor for downstream callers.
- Module ready for Phase 2 engine rebuild — not yet wired into live scoring
  to preserve regression stability.

### New invariants
- #38: W(yogakaraka) = base × YK_MULT and returns immediately — no further
  house or role modifiers stack on top of yogakaraka status.
- #39: W(neutral, non-kendra/dusthana) = base_weight exactly (no noise added).

### Guardrail compliance
- G06: WeightContext.g06_compliant flags KP+Lahiri as non-compliant.
  Full fix deferred to S212 (ayanamsha selection).

### Three-Lens Notes
- Tech: Introduces the Layer I weight infrastructure that Phase 2 will wire
  into the full engine. All existing scores are unchanged (not yet wired).
- Astrology: Encodes functional dignity primacy (V.K. Choudhry Systems Approach
  Ch.3) and house-type promise hierarchy (BPHS Ch.11) as computable functions.
- Research: Context-conditional weights are a prerequisite for SHAP analysis
  (Phase 6) — static weights produce uninterpretable attribution.

---

## S195 — 2026-03-28 — Feature Decomposition Infrastructure

**Tests:** 1517 passing, 3 skipped, 0 lint errors

### What was built
- `src/calculations/feature_decomp.py`: `RuleFeature`, `HouseFeatureVector`,
  `ChartFeatureVector` dataclasses + `extract_features(chart, school)`.
  Four extractors: `gentle_sign` (R01), `bhavesh_dignity` (R04 continuous),
  `dig_bala` (R20), `sav_bindus_norm` (R23 continuous).
  4 features × 12 houses = 48 features. G22 compliance note in module docstring.

## S196 — 2026-03-28 — Feature Extractors: kartari, combust, retrograde, bhavesh_house_type

**Tests:** 1525 passing, 3 skipped, 0 lint errors

### What was built
- `feature_decomp.py` +4 extractors: `kartari_score` (R08/R12), `combust_score` (R19),
  `retrograde_score` (R22), `bhavesh_house_type` (R04 placement). 8 × 12 = 96 features.
